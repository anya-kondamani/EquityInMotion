## Equity In Motion

This project was submitted to Kode with Klossy's Health Equity challenge in partnership with Deloitte and Deloitte Health Equity Institute.

I utilized React, Javascript, CSS and Google's Teachable Machine to complete this project. My objective was to address health inequity from a physical activity perspective. EquityInMotion provides a user experience that consists of learning exercises and yoga poses with detailed instructions and moving on to practicing and correcting form with a machine learning tool. Simple physical activity and exercise can act as a recovery, a preventative measure, and encouragement towards a more active lifestyle. While this effort does not erase the significant hurdles that stand in the way of health equity such as unfair wages and lack of accessible health care, it takes advantage of general accessibility to the internet and provides those who do not have the luxury of physical therapy, yoga and workout classes, and private gyms with the ability to pursue better health.
